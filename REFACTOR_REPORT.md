# Refactor Report: messy-migration Assignment

## Overview
This report summarizes the improvements made to the legacy Flask-based user management API as part of the refactoring process.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Secure Database Access
- Replaced all raw SQL queries with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implemented per-request database connections using Flask's `g` context and teardown logic for safe, thread-friendly access.

### 2. Modular Code Structure
- Separated database logic into helper functions (e.g., `fetch_all_users`, `insert_user`, etc.).
- Route functions now focus only on request/response handling, improving readability and maintainability.

### 3. Consistent JSON API Responses
- All endpoints now return JSON responses using Flask's `jsonify`.
- Proper HTTP status codes are used for success and error cases (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 401, 500).

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Added try/except blocks to all endpoints to catch and report errors gracefully.
- Clear error messages are returned to the client for all exceptions.

### 5. Input Validation
- Added validation for required fields in all POST/PUT requests.
- Email format is checked using a regular expression.
- Passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

### 6. Code Readability
- Added docstrings to major functions.
- Improved naming and code comments for clarity.

## Testing
- All endpoints were tested after refactoring to ensure functionality remained correct and error handling worked as expected.

## Recommendations
- For further improvements, consider splitting the code into multiple files (routes, models, utils) as the project grows.
- Add automated tests for all endpoints.
- Consider using Flask extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy for more complex projects.
